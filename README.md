Using Informative Features in Machine Learning Based Method for COVID-19 Drug Reporpusing


This repository contains the data and MATLAB code for the  "Using Informative Features in Machine Learning Based Method for COVID-19 Drug Reporpusing" paper:

Descripotion:


First, we use two effective algorithms [Algorithm1 folder and Algorithm2 folder] to find the candidate set of proteins from biological networks that lead to a major disruption in the network.
To run the Algorithm1 follow the Readme.txt steps in Algorithm1 Folder. See the output of Algorithm1 in "Essential_Proteins_related_to_Covid_19.xlsx" file in sheet name output_Cut1.
To run the Algorithm1 follow the Readme.txt steps in Algorithm2 Folder. See the output of Algorithm2 in "Essential_Proteins_related_to_Covid_19.xlsx" file in sheet name output_Cut2.

Next, we identify proteins in our candidate set that are associated with some underlying diseases related to COVID-19. We select 93 proteins as a final set of essential proteins related to disease pathology. 
To access to the 93 proteins see Essential_Protein_related_to_Covid_19_Pathology.xlsx file in sheet name "E".
